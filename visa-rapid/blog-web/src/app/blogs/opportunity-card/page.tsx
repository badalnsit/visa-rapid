                        <p className="mb-4">
                            The Germany Opportunity Card, known locally as the Chancenkarte, represents a revolutionary shift in German immigration policy. Launched as part of Germany's skilled immigration reform, this residence permit opens doors for international professionals seeking employment opportunities in one of Europe's strongest economies.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            Unlike the restrictive Job Seeker Visa that preceded it, the Opportunity Card Germany introduces a flexible, points-based immigration system designed to attract diverse talent to the German labor market.
                        </p>

                        <p className="mb-4">
                            The German Opportunity Card is a special residence permit issued as a Category D visa by German embassies and consulates worldwide. This permit grants holders up to one year to pursue two primary objectives in Germany:

                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Job hunting:</strong> Search for qualified employment matching your skills and qualifications</li>
                            <li><strong>Qualification recognition:</strong> Complete the process of having foreign professional credentials recognized in Germany</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            This dual-purpose approach makes the Chancenkarte Germany significantly more versatile than previous immigration options.

                        <p className="mb-4">
                            The transformation from the Job Seeker Visa to the Opportunity Card marks a fundamental shift in German immigration policy:
                        </p>

                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3 font-open-sans">1. Previous System: Job Seeker Visa</h3>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                            <li>Limited exclusively to university graduates</li>

                            <li>No work permission during the visa period</li>
                            <li>Narrow eligibility criteria</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3 font-open-sans">2. New System: Germany Opportunity Card</h3>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Expanded eligibility:</strong> University graduates AND vocational qualification holders</li>

                            The Opportunity Card Germany particularly benefits professionals with apprenticeships or vocational training. Since Germany typically doesn't automatically recognize foreign apprenticeships as equivalent to German vocational qualifications, applicants can now enter Germany to complete the recognition process before beginning their job search.
